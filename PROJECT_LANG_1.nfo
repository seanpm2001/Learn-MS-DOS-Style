' Project language file 1
' For: seanpm2001/Learn-MS-DOS-Style
' About:
' I decided to make MS-DOS Style the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-MS-DOS-Style) as MS-DOS Style is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the MS-DOS Style language. It only makes sense to MS-DOS Style the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.'
